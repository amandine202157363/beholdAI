# JUNIOR DATA SCIENCE - CODING TEST 

MOTIVATION: Assess the performance of a supervised machine learning model that classifies CXRAYs as Normal or Abnormal. The evaluation will be based on two characteristics: patient's gender and image manufacturer (i.e. brand capturing the image). A successful end of this project will result in concluding on the accuracy of the model varying across gender and manufacturers. 

DATASETS: 

(1) ID, Accession Number, Gender, Manufacturer 

(2) Accession Number, Radiologist Diagnosis 

(3) Accession Number, Model Output 

METHOD: Data cleaning; Visualisation methods (i.e. barplots, interactive charts); Logistic Regression for independent (i.e. gender and manufacturer) and dependent (i.e. model's performance) categorical variables.
